crebrescunt—⁷68. Non tolerabile nomen3 above, 613, 617, the women
were described as gazing upon the great sea, and weeping, and as weary os
suffering (perferre) its hardships, The very name of the sea was suggestive
of woe, and was intolerable. Numen, given in many editions on the best
authority, is less likely to be the true reading, as no numen or divine power
was ascribed to the sea, and a numen could hardly be called intolerabile,
without disrespect. 770. Quos. Gr. ἓ 205, R. 2, (1). 771. Consan-
gnineo3 Acestes is Dardanian. 772. Bryon a sacrifice is made to Eryx,

for his interposition to prevent any further disaster by sea to the fleet of Aeneas.
Neptune reminds her of his former friendly acts to Aeneas botb on sea and land, and

the voyage. Meanwhile, the whole fleet proceeds unde'r full sail, led by the ship of
Aeneas, which is steered by the pilot Palinurus. In the night Aeneas aud all on
board sall asleep, except Palinurus, who watches‚and keeps the helm alone. Somnus
descende from tho sky, and tompts him to sleep, ai: 1, in spite os his resistance‚ over-
powcrs him with the Lethcan influenee.
