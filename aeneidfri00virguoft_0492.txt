because he brought it into the upper world when he descended to Hades to
seize the dog Cerberus. Being sacred to Hercules, the god of toil, it was
worn as a wreath by those who were about to engage in severe labor, such
as that of rowing. Thus Horace, O. 1, 7, 23, makes Teucer put on a poplar ἵ
wreath, when on the point of resuming his voyage, and encountering new
hardships; ‘⁶ Tempora populea fertur vinxisse corona.” Others understand
the poplar wreath to have reference to the fuum-eal character of the gameS.
