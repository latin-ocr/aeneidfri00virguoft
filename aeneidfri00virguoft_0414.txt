Does “the highest story '' here signify that of the tower, or the summit of
the palace itsels? Dr. Henry understands it to be the latter, and it. is diffi-
ωλι to conceive why the Trojans should loosen the highest story of the
tower. Their object was to tear the tower from the roof of the palam,
(altis sedibus, summis tectis‚) and Virgil probably means that the joinings at
that point were separated. The summa tabulata, or highest flooring of the
palaee, was the base of the tower, and if the tower was of wood, it could be
easily thrown down in one mass, when loosened and separated from the
summit of the palace. 464, 465. Altis sedibu83 from its lofty founda-
