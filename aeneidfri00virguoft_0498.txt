he vainly struggles to pull himself along, not by gliding or ereeping in the
usual manner of snakes, but by throwing himself into eont01·tions; each
knot, undulation, or coil, serring as a sort of lever. The snalre osten makes
this convulsive effert when wounded. Thus the ship is erippled on one
side, so that with her remaining oars she is ineapable of advaneing3 and
here ends the reseniblance to the snake. But yet, (tamen‚) notwithstanding
the loss of a part of her oars, and her inability to advanee with the aid of
those that remain, she is brought into the harbor slowly with the help of

286-361. Description of the soot-raee. Aeneas chooses a circular meadow,enci1·eled
by wooded hills, as a circus or race ground. He invites all who wish to make trial of
their speed ina soot raee to present themselves. The most prominent competitors
are Nisus, Euryalus, Diores, Salius, Patron, Helymus, and Panopes. Nisus takes the
lead, Salius is next, and third Euryalus, followed by Helymus and Diores. Near the
goat Nisus salle down, bnt gives the victory to his friend Euryalus by tripping np Sa-
lius. Helymus takes the second prize and Diores the third. The idea os the soot race
is suggested by 11. xxiii. 740-797.
