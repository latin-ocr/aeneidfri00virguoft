for the whole city—Circum. See note on 32. The series of pictures
here mentioned, which we must imagine to be painted on panels on the
walls of the temple, consists of, 1. The victory of the Trojans under Hector3
2. The victory of the Greeks under Aehilles3 3. The death of Rhesus; 4.
The deathof Troilus} 5. The Trojan matrons before the statue of Mincrva;

The battle of the Amazons with the Greeks.—--4(37-4GS· ssacg adverb;

tlte Trojan youth pureum& here (on the next panel) the Trojans (were flying,
while) the crested Achilles in his charior} pressed on. The first of these
scenes is suggested by the Iliad, xiv. 143 the second by Il. xx. sq.

Nec procul hinc3 and not far from hence ,· i. e. from that part of the series
of paintings which has been mentioned in the preceding verses. Rhesi.
Rhesus, a Thracian prinee, who had come to the aid of Priam, and encamped
on the night of his arrival outside of the city. It was fated that Troy
should not fall unless the horses of Rhesus should come into the possession
of the Greeks before they had tasted of the pasturage of Troy, and drunk
of the river Xanthus. In the Il. x. 433, Ulysses and Diomed penetrate into
the camp os Rhesus on this first night of his arrival, slay the chief himself,
and twelve of his followers, and convey the horses to the Grecian camp.

 

 

 

 

Niveis velisg with their snowy eoverz'nffs. Gr. ξ 211, R. 6. In the
heroic age cents were not used ; but huts made of turf and interwoven twigs.
The poet employs the language of his own day, and the painter takes a simi—
lar liceum—470. Primo prodita 501110. Translate literally: betrayed hy
tlte first sleep, i. e. by the sleep of the first night, or during the hours of
sleep on the first night after his arrival. This is the obvious meaning,
though many take primo somno in the sense of the first part, 01· the earliest,
and so deepest‚part of slumber. But the passage of the Iliad in the lOth
Book, which Virgil here had in mind, by no means justifies the idea that
Rhesus was slain in the early hours of the night, or of sleep. 171. Vasta-
batg had been devastatiny. He was not represented in the painting as actu-
ally engaged iu slaughter, but the bodies of the slain, scattered around in
the picture, suggest this idea, which is made more impressive by the imper-
fect tense. 472. Avertit3 is leadiny au·ay; driviozss away. This is the
immediate suchct, or, so to speak, the action of the picture. Castra rc-
fcrs to the Grecian camp. 473. Gustasseut. The pluperscct is used here
after an lcistorical present3 after a real present, it would not be thus used.
For the mood, see Gr. ξ 263, 3; Ζ. ξ 576. siu. Parte alia3 in another

“Troilus is only once named in thc Iliad (xxiv. ⁶257); he was also mentioned in
the Cypria3 but his youth, beauty, and untimely cnd made him an object of
great interest with the subsequent poets.'' Grote‚ 1, p. 399. Armis.
