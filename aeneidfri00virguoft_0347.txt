BOOK F1Rs‘r. 325

Servius, not for cooking any portion of the flesh, sor boiling was not then
practised, but for washing the hands. Perhaps, however, the poet had in
mind, as is frequently the case, the custoxns of his own times⁴ 214-15.
[fusi—ferinae· And, ‘reclined alony the yrass, they fill themselves (lit., are
being filled) with old wine, ancl the fat yame. After ferinae supply carnis ‚·
see Gr. ἓ 205, R. 7, (1). Bacchi is put for wine, as above, 177, Ceres for
wheat. So frequently Vulean for fire, Jupiter for the sky, δίο. For the
genitive after implentur, sec Gr. ξ 220, 3; Ζ. ἓ 463. 216. Postquam, and
other adverbs of time, when they signify as soon as, are followed by the
perfect (or impevfect) rather than by the plupeifeet. Gr. ξ 259, R. 1, (2),
(d); Z. ἓ 507, b. Mensae remotaeg the viands were removed ,· literally,
tlte tables. The expression is derived not from the practiceof the heroic,
but from that of the Augustan age, when light, movable tables were often
used, on which the food was brought into the triclinium, and placed before
the guests. See woodeut, page 3⁷60. Hence the removal of tables came to
signify the removal ο)ι the sood. 217. amissos—requirunt, they mourn
in continued conversation their missiny β’·ἰθηαζς. Requirunt here is very
nearly desiderant, reyret. 218. Credant depends on dubii. Gr. ἓ 265.
Seu and sive are used by poetic license for utrum aud an, whether, or.
219. Extrema pati; that they are sufferiny the last; that they are dyiny.
vocatos; when called. Perhaps Virgil alludes to the custom of pronouncing
the word vale over the body of the dead, as soon as he had ceased to breathe,
and also at the funeral pyre, when the body had been burncd. 229.
Oronti. Gr. ξ 86. 221. Secnm3 with himself, because, as mentioned
above, 209, he disguises his grief from his followers.

plating the affairs of men, and with tears complains of the hardships of Aeneas, who
is debari-ed, through the anger of JunO. from his destined home in Italy, in spite of his
piety, and the fatos, and the promises of Jupiter, while Antenor, another Trojan
prince, has been permitted already to find a resting-place on the shores of the Adriat-
ic. Jupiter consoles her by reaffirming the promise that she shall hereaftcr receive
her son into Olympus, and that his descendants in Italy, the Romans, shall rule tho
world. Mercury is then sent down to Cart11age‚iu order to exercise a secret influence
on queen Dido and the Carthaginians, that they may be prepared to give the Trojans
a friendly reception.

 

223. Fini83 an end, i. e. of their mournful conversation. Aethere

look-inq upzoard. Gr. ξ 197, 7. velivolum3 studded with soils. The
term is more commonly applied to the ship “flying with sails,'' but is
here transferred to the sea itself. Jacente83 spread out,· as they would
appear when seen from a great height above. 225. Latos populos = late
