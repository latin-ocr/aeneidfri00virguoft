at Troy, thus leaving to the vietor his shield as a trophy, which is now
fastened upon the door-post, (facing the visitor, adversm) so as to meet the
eye of one entering the temple. Shields were often suspended in temples
as votive offerings, and it is as such a token of reverenee and gratitude that
Aeneas thus presents the shield of Abas in the temple of Apollo. ’ 237.

290-505. Aeneas sails again to the northward, and lauds at Pelodes, the scaport of
Buthrotum, in Epirus. At Buthrotum he has an interview with Helenus, the brother
of Hector, and Andromache, formerly the wife of Hector, and more recently the slavo
of Pyrrhus, but now the wife of Helenus. By a wonderful eombination of events,
Helenus and Andromache have corne to bc the rulers of Chaonia, a part of Epirus
Just before parting with Aeneas, Helenus, who is a priest and prophet, gives him in-
structions and warnings about his future course 3 informing him that his new kingdom
is to bc planted, not on the nearest (or Adriatic) shore of Italy, but on the fai-thest (or
Tyrrheniam) shore 3 that he must pass round the peninsula, shunning the new Greek
colonies, established by Idomeneus, the Locri, and Philoctetes3 that he must not cn-
ter the straits of Scylla and Charybdis, (the straits between Italy and sicum but sail
round Sicily by the south, and enter the Tusean sea from Drepanum, that he must
seek an interview with the prophetess or Sibyl at Cumae, (near Naples) who will
give him directions for his future gmdance.

(comp. Hom. 11. vi. 76.) Being made prisoner by the Greeks, he was ear-
ried by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, to Epirus. That the son of the prinei-
pal enemy of the Greeks should now be a king in Grecian citios fills Aeneas
with surprise. The position of the words ainis the conti-ast of ideas.
