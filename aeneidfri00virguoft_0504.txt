Eryx3 but the life of the bull is given as a more aeeeptable sacrifice. Eryx
was the master of Entellus, and has just now, as a god, sccured him the
victory. Hence the buil is offered to Eryx, to whom (perhaps) he now
dedieates his arms, in retii-ing forever from pugilistic combats. For it was
the custom sor retii-ed gladiators and soldiers to hang up their arnis to their
patron gods in some temple. 484. Person-o denotes full paymcnt of a
debt3 here the sense is sacrifice in fulfilment of vows to Eryx.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

485-544. The trial of skill in archery. There are four competitore: Hippocoon,
Mnestheus, Eurytion, Acestes. Their order is determined by lot. The mark is a
dove fastened by a cord to a ship’s mast, erected for the purpose on the plain. Tho
arrow of Hippocoon strikes the mast, but misses the bird. Mnestheus hits the string
only, and the bird escapeS. Eurytion kills her on the wing. Acestes discharges his
ari-ow into the air at random. The arrow takes* flre and disappears in thc sky. In
consequence of this miracie the old man is pronounced victor. The contest is suggest-
ed by Hom. 11. xxiii. 850-873.
