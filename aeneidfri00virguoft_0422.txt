in v. 396. Stant rohore3 whose strengytlz remains firm in its own vz'yor,
needing the aid of none3 sor the ablat. see on i. 268, and above, 88.—
640. Agitate3 urgse forwerd‚· implying both planning and executing.——
612. Satis superque3 there is an ellipsis of est and quod; it is enouyh and
more that I have seen, δίο. The pl. as 7108, sih—[ina necessarily follows
the number of excidia, (Gr. ἓ 118, R. 2; Z. g 115, note,) which is put in the
plural, perhaps, to suggest all the appalling circumstances attending the
destruction of a city. Troy had been captured and sacked by Hercules
during the reign of Laomedon; Priam has survived that capture of the
city by Hercules, and that is enough. He does not wish to outlive the
second sack of Troy, now being made by the Greeks.-—-Supcravimus‚
for supevfuimus; asin 597, and iii. 339. The dative is under the general
rule, Gr. 225st Z. cios—614. Sic positum3 thus, 0 thus, ἰθέης). He is
reelining on a conch, in the position of one dead, or dying. Comp. iv.
631. mati 3 haviny bid sarewell to me. It was the cust0m‚ immediately

 

 

on the decease of a Roman, for the nearest relative at the bedside to
call on the dead by name, and utter three times in a loud voice the word
vale. See iii. 68, and vi. 506. This eeremony was also repeated at the
funeral pile, and at the tonib. Anchises wishes them to trcat him as if al-
ready dead, aud bid him fai-ewell. 615. This line has caused much dis·
cussion. ,Μαιηι is understood by some to signify, by my own leand, that
is, by suicide; by others the enemy's hand, and by others simply violence,
or a death inssieted by α human leand, as opposed to a natural death. The
latter, which is Thiel's interpretation, is probably correct. The words may
be rendered: as sor me, I shall meet my skalk by violence. Miserebitul'3
the enemy will show compassion,· that is, they will put me out of my misery,
by slaying me, while secking to plunder my house and person. 616.
Facilis jactura sepulchri3 the loss of burial is easy. This sentiment is very
unnatural for a Greek or Roman. Coxnp. iv. 620, vi. 333. 618. Demoror.
Gr. ξ 145, 1, 2. Ex (11103 supply tempore. 649. Fulminis afflavit veu-

ancient philosopher& to propel the lightning from the clouds. Anchises

amour with the goddess Venus. (350. Perstab3t3 figurativcly; lie per-
