322 noras os THE AENEID.

157-222. Aeneas with seven of his ships lande in a secure haven, not far from tho
new city of Carthage. Leaving his compauions a while, he ascende the neighboring
rocks to obtain a view of the sea, in the hope or descrying the rest of his ficet. He
raus in with a herd of decr, and thus secures food sor his friends, whom he addresses,
on returning‚ with consoliug words.

157. Aeneadae. Followers of Aeneas. Gr. ἓ 100, i. (3) Quae—-
litora. Gr. ἓ 206, (3). lee shores which are nearest. Supply sunt. See
Οτι-,ἓ 209, R. 43 Z. §we—158. Libyae. The country around Carthago was
strictly Africa; Libya was the region between Africa and Egypt3 but
the poets use geographical terms with great freedom. 159. secessu
long03 in a deep recess. It is not likely that Virgil is describing a real
scene on the African coast, though some have tried to identify the spot.
1⁶0. Insula—laterum3 an island forms a haven by the opposition of its
sides. Lying along in front of the cove, and against (ob) the sea, it forms a
natural breakwater. Quibus, the ablativa, means of frangitur and scindit:
by which. every wave from the deep is broken, and divides itself into the deep
windinys of the hay ; that is, rolls broken, and so with diminished force,
into the haven. Heyne, however, understands by reductos sinus the “re-
ceding curves '‘ formed by the ware itself. 162. Hinc atque hlne; οη this
side and on this; on either side ,· not hinc atque illinc, because the two
points are conceived to be equally near to the spectator. Geminig two
similar clzffs ‚· two rocky promontories, forming the opposite extremities or
headlands of the cove- 164. Tum—umbra3 αι the same time a cuv-cain
of woods with gylancz'nq soliagye, and a mass ⁰f trees οἶαι-λε with rouyheniny
skadow overlzany from above. The roeky heights which form the sides and
back part of the haven are crowned all around with dark masses of trees,
whose foliage, agitated by the wind, and constantly varying in light ano
shade, is described as glaucing in the light, or coruscatiny. Virgil applies
the term scena, statere-view, to this landseape, because it resembles the stage
of the Roman theatre, when prepared for the sports of fanus and Satyrs.
For on such occasions the side walls of the stage, which in the Roman the-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

atre curved towards the middle, and the back wall, which was straight, were
decorated with paintings or painted hangings of trees and glades to represent
a sylvan scene. Silvis coruscis 3 an ablative of quality or description; usu-
ally rendered like the genitive: offlasln'uy woods. See Gr. ἓ 211, R. ὃς Ζ.
ξ 471, note. The usage is described by Madvig thus: The ablativo of a
substantive combined with an adjective (participle or pronoun) is subjoined
to a substantive by way of description either directly or after the verb esse,
to denote the quality and character of a person or thing. Madv. ἓ 272.
-—165. Desuper3 from abore; in contrast with sub vertice. Horrenfi3
I prefer the litei-al meaning, ronyh, ὒνίείιῖἱηῃ, projectiny, according to Wag-
ner‘s interpretation, as more appropriate here than the translation yloomy,
anve-inspirinffi which is more generally given. Nemus is added to scena
by way of epexcycsz's, or more elaborate description.—166· Fronte sul) ad-
