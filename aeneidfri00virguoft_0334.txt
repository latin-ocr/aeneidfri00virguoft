——et coegi—at nunc horrentia Martis arma virumque cano, The latter is the
construction generally adopted. Ι have preferred, however, to place the
words by themselves, and to translate them as a complete sentence, thus:
Ι, that poet who formerly tnned my song with the slender pipe, and, coming
forth from the woods, taught the neighboring fields to obey the husband-
man, however eager for harvestS——a work aeeeptable to‘ tillers of the soil—
yet now describe the horrors of war. Opus ,· the work is that expressed in
modulatas sum and coefi. Dico or cono must be understood with horrentia
Martis. ι

BOOK FIRST.

The storin at sea, the landing of Aeneas near Carthago,
and his receptior] at the palace of Dido.

1-7. In the opening passage‘the subject and plan of the work are indicated. Aene-
as, his wanderings by sea and land, and his wars in Italy. In multum et terrisjaclatus
et alto we have the subject of the first six books of the work, which thus sar resem-
bles tho Odysscy3 in mulla quoque et bello possus we have that which is embraced in
the last six books, in which the poet describes battles and single combals like those
of the Iliad.

1—2. I siny of arms and the man ἰυῘιο first, by fate an exile, came from
tlte coast of Troy to Ital y and the Lavinian shores. Qui. In prose the rela-
tive stands uniformly at the beginning of its clause, except occasionally
when placed after prepositions. We shall find it very often in poetry, as
here, out of its proper place. Primus. The sense of* the word here is:
primo, in the first place, in the begyimzz'n9; i. e. in the very beginning of
Roman tradition. This accords with Heyne's interpretation, and it is more
natural than any other which has been proposed. Primus as an adjectivo is
very frequently substituted for the adverb primun? or primo ; see Gr. ἓ 205,
R. 15, (b); Z. ἓ 686. It is used precisely thus in viii. 319. There, as the
first event in the history of Latin civilization, Saturn is said to have come
from Olympus: primus (primo, in principio) venit ab Olympo ³. here, in the
passage before us, as the earliest tradition in Roman history, Aeneas is said
to have landed ιη Latium. It 1s thus tzh rt the old Roman chronicle begins
(sce Livy I. 1) nith the story of Aeneis, as the fi’⁸² sict to be recorded:

with Forbigcr and others, that no Trojan did reach Italy before Aeneas, be·
