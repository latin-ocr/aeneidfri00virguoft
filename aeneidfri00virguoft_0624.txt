With Notes, for the use of Schools and CollcgeS. By E. A. JOHNSON,
Professor of Latin in the Univcisity of Now York. 121110. 459

pagos

Tuis edition of Cicero's Select Orations possesses some special advantages sor the
student which are both new and important. It is the only edition which contains the
improved text that has been prepared by a recent careful collation and correct de-
ciphering os the best manuscripts of Cicero's writings. It is the work of the celebrated
Orelli, Madvig, and Klotz, and has been done since the appearance of Orelli's complete
edition. The Notes, by Professor Johnson, of the New York University, have been
mostly selected, with great care, from the best German authors, as well as the English
edition of Arnold. ’

From TnonAs 0111153, Tutor in Latin in llarvczrcz Universt'ty.

“An edition oi* Cicero like Johnson's has long been wanted3 and the excellence of
tLe text, the illustrations of words, particles, and pronouns, and the explanation ol
various points of construction and interpretation, bear witness to the Editor's famili-
arity with some of the most important results of modern scholarship, and entitlc his
work to a large share of public ilwor.”

“It seems to us an improvement upon any edition of these orations that has been
published in this country, and will be found a veluable aid in their siddies to the lovers
of classical literature.”— Troy Daily ΠἿιὶῃ.

Cicero's de Officiis :
With English Notes, mostly translated from ZUMPT and Bormam. By
THOMAS A. THAGHER, of Yale Collcge. 12mo, 194 pages.

In this edition, a few historical notes have been introduced in casos where the
Dictionary in common use has not been found to eontain the desired infel-matium the
design oi which is to aid the learner in understanding the contents of the treatises, the
thoughts and reasoning ot' the author, to explain grammatica] difficulties, and inculcata
aknowledge of grammatical principles. The Editor has aimed throughout to guido
rather than carry the learner through difficulties; requiring of him more study, in
consequence os his help, than, he would have devoted to the book without it.

From M. L. Sronvnn, Profe-³307* osllze Latin Lanquaqe and liter-amre in
Pennsylvania c'olleqe.

“ Ι heve examined with much pleasure Prof. Thnchcr's edition oi' Cicero de Officiis,
and am convinced oi’ its excellence. The Notes have been prepared with great care
and good judgment. Praetical knowledge of the wants oi* tho student has enabled the
Editor to furnish just the kind of assistance required; grammaticali difficulties are
removed, end the obscurities or the treatiso are explained, the interest οἰ the learner
ls elicited, and his industry directed rather than superseded. There can be but one
opinion with regni-(l to the merits of the work, nnd I trust that Professor Thnchcr wlll
bo disnosed ω continue his labors so carei'ully commenced, ln this department of classi-

cal learnimz.”
