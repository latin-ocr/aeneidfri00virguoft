536 NOTES ON THE AENEID.

the elder Scipio Africanus from the attacks of Cat03 and lns two sona, Tibe-
rius and Caius Gracchus, who lost their lives in their vain struggle to ame<
liorate the condition of the. plebeian order at Rome. 843. Scipiadasg
Cicero (pro Balbo, 15) calls the brothers Cneius and Publius Scipio, who fel]
in the campaigns in Spain against Hasdrubal, cluo fulmina nostri imperii;
the reference herc, however, is to Scipio Africanus Major, who closed the
second Punic war by defeating Hannibal at Zama, and Scipio Africanus
Minor, who captured and destroyed Carthage in the third Punic war. The
latter was the son of Aemilius Paulus, and a Scipio only by adoption.
813. Parvo potentem rich in poverty‚· potens often signifies opulentus,-
parvo is used substantively, and the ablative denotes situation. Fabricius,
though poor, was wholly uninfluenced by the offered bribes of Pyrrhus.
See Liddell's Hist. of Rome, 3, 26, 9. 844. Serrane 3 Caius Atilius Regu-
lus, consul in B. C. 257, surnamed Serranus, because when his election was
announced he was found cultivating his land, or plantiny in the ίαν-νοω, sulco
serentem. He gained a naval victory over the Carthaginians near the Liparae-
an islands. He was also consul in B. G. 250, the year when his still more
celebrated namesake, the captive Regulus, came from Carthage on his mission
to the Roman senate sor the exchange of prisoners. 845. Maximus3 this
was an appellation οἱ many of the Fabii. The one here referred to retrieved
the fortunes of Rome, after the great disaster at Lake Trasimenus, by keep-
ing the field with a Roman army, and yet avoiding any general engagement.
846. Α verse borrowed from Ennius. 847. spirantia nerag the
breatlcz‘ny bronze; life-like statues of bronze. Mollius; it is one of the
triumphs of the sculptor's art to make the bronze or marblc imitate the soft
outlines of the human form. Thus Cicero (Brut. 18) says: Calamidis dura
illa (signa) quidem, sed tamen MOLLIORA quam Canachi. 849. orabunt
causas meliu83 Roman oratory in the time of Virgil had attained to an ex-
cellence which might well vie with that of the Athenians3 but here the
great national distinction of the Romans, their greatness as warriors and
conquerors, is to be presented as contrasted with those arts which charac-
terize the Greeks. Cocli meatu83 the movements of the keavenly bodies.
85⁰. Radi03 with the wand; the astronomer drew his diagram with a
rod on wet sand spread upon a table. 852. Morem3 the term-3, or con-
dition-s. 855. Marcellus3 the great Marcellus of the second Punic war,
who obtained the third spolia opima, (see above, ou 841‚) and was the first
Roman general who gave a decided eheck to Hannibal. The mention of
this great commander leads to the following allusion to his descendant, the
youthsul Marcellus, son of Octava, and adopted son of Augustus, whose un-
timely death caused universal grief among the Romans. His death occurred
in B. C. 23, while Virgil was engaged in the composition of the Aeneid—
862. Laeta parum 3 equivalent to tristior ; too sad sor a youth. The shade
is sancied to have already a forecast of his brief life in the world above.—
