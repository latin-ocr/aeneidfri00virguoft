LIFE AND WRITINGS OF VIRGIL. XV

was again disturbes] by the demands of the veterans, and our
poet in vain, though at the risk of his life, attempted to main-
tain his rights against the centurion Arrius. Fleeing again
for succor to Octavian, he was reinstated, though not without-
lon g and anxious delay, in the possession of his farm. During
this period of delay and depressing uncertainty, he wrote the
ninth Eclogue, in Which he bewails his unhappy lot. But on
obtaining at length the object of his petition‚ his joy and grati·
tude found utterance in the beautiful hymn called the fourth
Eelogue‚ in which he hails the auspicious times just dawning
on the world, and initiated by the consulship of his friend and
patron Pollio. The sixth Eclogue was composed in the fol-

Lat-in language, at the close of the second Punic war, by the
soldier and poet Ennius. But though distinguished by origi-
nality, strength, and vigor, the poetry of Ennius was harsh
and rugged to a degree which rendered it to the more culti-
vated tastes of later generations almost intolerable. Nor by
thepoets who succeeded Ennius had any such improvement
been made in the composition of Latin verse, as to admit of
any compar-ison between them and their Grecian models. It
was reserved for two great poets of Rome, two congenial spirits=
