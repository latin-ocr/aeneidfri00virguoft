The Works of Horace.

With English Notos, for the use of Schools and Colleges. By J. L.
LINOOLN3 Professor of the Latin Language and Literaturc in
Brown University. 121110, 575 pages.

The text of this edition is mainly that of Orelli, the most important readings oi
ether critics being given in foot-notes. The volume is introduced with a biographicel
sketch of Horace and a critique on his writings‚ which enable the student to enter in—
telligently on his work. Peculiar grammatica] constructione, as well as geographica]
and historica] allusione, are'explained in notes, which are just full enough to aid the
pupil, to excite him to gam a thorough understanding of the author, and awaken in him
a taste for philological studies without taking all labor off his hands. While the chief
aim has been to impart a clear ides of Latin Syntax as exhibited in the text, it has· also
been a cherished object to take adv.mtage of the means 50 variously and richly furnished
by Horace for promoting the poeti-al teste and literary culture of the student.

From an article by Paor. Bm, of the University of Heidelberq, in the Heidelbera
A2mal8 qs Literature.

“There are already several American editions of Horace, intended for the use of
schools3 of one of these, which has passed through many editions, and has also been
widely circulated in Enghznd, mention has been formerly made in this Journa13 but
that one we may not put upon an equality with the one now before us, inasmuch as
this has taken a different stand-point, which may serito as a sign of progress in this
department of study. The editor has, it is true, also intended his work for the use of
schools‚ and has sought to adapt tt, in all its parts, to such ause; but still, without
,osing sight of this purpose, he hat proceeded throughout with more independence. In
the preparation of the Notes, the editor has ihithsully observed the principles (laid
down in his preface); the explanavions of the poet's words commend themselves by a
compressed brevity which limits ivseu· to what is most essential‚ and by a sharp pre-
cision of expression ; and references to other passages of the poet, and also to gramars,
dictionarieS‚ &Q are not wanting.”

With Notes and a Vocabulary. By NOBLE BUTLER and MINARD
STURGUS. 12mo, 397 peges,

The edItors have spent 3, vast amount of time and labor in correcting the text, by
3 comparison of the most improved German and English editions. It is believed that
this will be round superior to any edition hitherto published in this country. In ac-
cordance with their chronological order, the “augustine'' precedes the “ (3111111110.ἰ
The N otes are copious and tersely expressed; they display not only fine scholarship‚
but (what is quite as necessary in such a book) a practieal knowledge of the difficulties
which the student encounters in reading this author, and the aids that he requires.

The Vocabulary was prepared by the late Winmam H. G. Bumn. It will be found an
able and faithful performanco.
