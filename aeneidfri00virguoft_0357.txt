:and dress osa virgin, and a Spartan viryin's arms. Wagner puts a comma
after arma, thus bringing Spartanae directly into contr-ast with Threissa;
thus the sense would be, the arms of a virssin, (either) Spartan or saa-lt as
the Thracian Harpalyce, &Q Gerens is regarded by some as a zeufymcm
but this seems unncccssary, as in the sense of “ bearing'' the word may ap-
ply to that which has been assumed, or put on, for the occasion, and hence
may with propriety be joined both with os, habitum, and arma. It impliefl

often have with qualis, as here, not only an ellipsis of its antecedent, talis,

all three are omitted; namely talis, est, qn& comp. below, 4983 iv. 143.
Harpalyce was a daughter of the Thracian king Harpalycus, and renowned
as a huntress. There were poetic traditione, aud perhaps statues, in exist-
ence, representing her engaged in the chase. Hence the present tense
fatiyat, and praevertitur. 317. Praevertitur· This verb, in the passive
form, is very rat-ely, as here, followed by the accusative in the sense of out-
8trip, 9⁰ bqfore; the active form is much more frequent, as vii. 807, and
xii. 345. Hebrum is probably the true reading, though Eurum, which
has been adopted in some editions, seems more suited to the context. The
Hebrus is the modern Alsarz'tza, which rises in the Balkan mountains and
⁸ runs into the Aegaeon—318. Eumerisg suspendere, in v. 489, is followed
by ab ‚· sometimes also by εκ and de, and also by the dative; as, suspendite
arbori, a phrase quoted by Livy (1. 1, c. 26) from an ancient Roman law.

statue of Diana with the stag, which is now in the gallery of the Louvre,
and also the one copied below from the Vatican, correspond in drapcry to
, this description. The dress consists of two pieces, the tunic underneath
and the mantle over it. The tunic is shortened by being partially drawn
up underneath the girdle, and· suffered to fall over it in a sold, forming a
sort of flounce, and thus bringing the bottom of the tunic a little above the
knec. The light and flowing mantle, (peplmn‚) which is long and wide, is
then folded, and knotted round the waist. It is this gathering up of tho
tunic and knotting of the mantlc that Virgil has in mind. 321. Prior.
