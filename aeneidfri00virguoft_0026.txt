But whatever defccts there may be 111 the Aeuom, it is re-
plete with all the qualities which are essential to a great work
of art. It is great in conception and invention. It is won-
derfully diversified in scenos, incidents‚ and characters, while
it never departs from the vital principle of unity. It is
adorned with the finest diction and imagery of which lan-
guagc is capable. In discoursing of great achievements and
great events, it never comes short of the grandem· which be-
fits the 01110 style 3 in passages of sorrow and suffering it takes
hold of our sympathies with all the power of the most 1101111-
rending tragedy. What a sublime 01110 of itself is the account
of the sack of Troy! what a tragedy of passion and fate is
presented in the death of Dido 1 Indeed the student will find
in the Aeneid many dramatic 5001105, many vivid pictures of
life and manners, many lively narratives of adventure, any 0110
of which would be of itself a poem, and would‘secure to its
author an cnviable fame.

Of the preeminent worth of Virgil’s poems, and of their
iinportance as literary studies, the most striking proof is pre-
sented in the fact that so many of the classics of modern
poetry, in all cultivated languages, havc manifestly been pro·
duced under the moulding and refining influence of this great
master of the art. Dante, who felt all the power of “ the
Mantuam„ ascribes to him whatever excellence he has himself
attained in beauty of style3 and, in the genereus avowal of
1115 indebtedness, he utters one of the noblest eulogies ever
bestowed by ‘any poet upon a brother poet.

Oh (10111 altri poeti onore 0 lumel,
Vagliami ‘l lungo studio, e il grande amore,
Che mi han fatto 0010111· 10 tuo volume!
Tu sei lo mio maestro e il mio autore:
Tu sei solo colui, da eu' io tolsi
Lo bello 51110, 0110 mi a fatto onore*
