494-612. Aeneas is lost in contemplating the llian pictures when Queen Dido enters
the temple, attended by a numerous trani, and proceeds to give audience to her people.
While Aeneas and Achates, still invisible, are watching the proceedings, they be-
hold Ilioneus and the other Trojan chiefs belonging to the missing ships, enterinss the
temple followed by a tumultueus crowd of the Carthaginians. Ilioneus, as the oldest
of the party, addresses the queen, and makes known their name, nation, and recent
mishap 3 complaining of the hostile disposition of her subjeets, who have attempted to
oppose the landing of the Trojans. IIe mentions Aeneas, and his uncertain fate, and
entreats the queen to aid the remnant of the Trojans to resume their voyage to Italy.
Dido makes a friendly reply, and apologizes for the harsh conduct of her subjecte.
She offers to give them the desired aid, or to receive them as citizens into her new
state. While she is expressing the Wish that Aeneas himself were present, and her
determination to send messengers everywhere in search of him, the cloud, which en-
veloped him, is suddenly dispelled, and he thus appears unexpectcdly in the presence
of the queen and his Trojan friends
