XlV LIFE AND WRITINGS OF VIRGIL.

agriculture, science, and letters. The Sicilian Greek, Theocri-
tus, was at this time his favor-ite author, and it was from him
that the general plan, though not the individual character, of
the Bucolics was derived.

The minor poems, such as the Culex, Ciris, Sec„ which

have been appendcd to the works of Virgil, and which are ,

sometimes reckoncd among his earlier productions, are as-
cribed to him on very insufficient grounds. The Eclogues
were commenced about Β. c. 42, at the request of O. Asinius
Pollio, who was then acting as the lieutenant of Antony in
Gaul. Pollio was himself distinguished as a poet, and not less-
as a scholar, orator, and historian. Under his patronage the
Eclogues numbered in the present arrangement 2, 3, and 5,
had already been written, when the literary labors and the
peaceful life of the poet were suddenly interrupted. The
veteran legions of Octavian, on returning from Philippi, and
demanding the allotments of land which had been promised
them as a reward for their services in the civil war, were
authorized to take possession of eighteen Italian citios, with
the district of country pei-taining to each. The cities thus
treated were those which had espoused the side of Brutus3
for this the unhappy occupants of the adjacent country were
forced to give up their hereditary estates to the rapacious
soldiery. As the lands of Cremona, which was one of the
condemned citieS, were not sufficient to satisfy the legion-
aries to whom they had been assigned, they took violent
possession also of a part of the country belonging to the
neighboring city of Mantua. Virgil, whose farm was in this
district, and was thus endangered, had recourse at first to
Pollio, and foratime was secure 1mder his protection. But
when that commander, in B. c. 41, marched with his troops
to thc aid os L. Antonius in the Perusian war, Virgil was
compelled to seek relief from Octavian in person, and sor this
purpose visited Rome. It was the kind reception given him
by the emperor on this occasion which inspired the grateful
and glowing eulogy contained in the first Ecloguc.
