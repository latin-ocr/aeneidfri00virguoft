would be renowned ἰη war and easily victorious for ayes. 145. Facilem
Victu3 equivalent to facile vincentes ‚· readily eonqzcerin9,· easily victorious.
The supine victu here is probably from vincere, taken in the active sense, to
conquer. The supines auditu and relatu are so used in the passage quoted
by Ladewig(1st edition) from Pliny's Ep. v. 6, 3. The interpretation of
Heyne, “easy to be supported, easy to be nourished,'’ from vivo, would be
indicated by the head of an ox better than by that of a horse. Ladewig,
however, seems in his last edition to have adopted Heyne's interpretation.
The coins of Carthage, in commemoration of this story, were stamped with
the image of a horse. 446. Sidonia. Vix-gn uses as synonymous the

offering to the temple. 448-449. Aerea. Gr. ξ 128, i. 1. The eostly
material of the door, bronze, indicates the splendor of the temple. The
idea is still more impressed by its repetition in aere and ahenis, as well as
by the position of the terms at the beginning and end of the verse. Comp.

ing sumebant, is equivalent to cujus, limiting 9⁷·adibus; from whose steps
arose a tkreslcold of bronze. Nexae aere trab853 timbers bound with
bron2e; this describes the bronze door-posts‚ which were heavy timber-s
cased or covered over with bronze. The Greek terms, χρουσόδετος, gold-
bound, and χαλκόδετος, bronze-bound, or simply bronze, are analogous to
neaeae aere ,· as, ἐν χαλκοδέτοις αὐλαῖς; Antigone, 945. FuribuS3 in the
dative after stridebat, instead of a genitive, forum, limiting cardo ,· and this
