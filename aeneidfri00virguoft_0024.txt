, filled with the most lively admiration of each other, laboring
side by side, both striving earnestly for the same object,—it
was reserved forVirgil and Horace to elevate the national
poetry to a character worthy of Rome, to develop all the re-
sources of their noble language, and to make it flow both in
heroic and lyrie verse with all the grace and dignity which
had hitherto been characteristic of the Greek alone.

After the publication of the Eclogues, Virgil appears to
have passed the remainder of his life chiefly at N aples. His
feeble health was probably the occasion of this.

It was here that he composed the Georgics, a didactic
poem in four books, in which he endeavors to recall the Ital-
ians to their primitive, but long neglected pursuit of agricul-

works of our poet, and, indeed, as Addison remarks, it may
be regarded as in this respect the most perfect of all poems.
In the first book he treats of the mana-gement of fields, in the
second of trees, in the third of horses and cattle, and in the

Having devoted seven years, from Β. o. 37 to B. C. 30, to
the writing of this work, and conscious that. his poetic labors
Β must be ended by an early death, he now entered upon the
long cherished plan of composing an Epic in the Homeric
style, which should at once commemorate the glory of Rome “
and of Octavian, and win back the Romans, if possible, to the
religious virtues of their progenitors. He chose for his theme
the fortunes of Aeneas, the fabled founder of the Julian fiuni-
ly3 and, hence, called his epic the Aeneid, which he divided
into twelve books. He had already been employed eleven
years upon this great work, and had not yet put to it the fin-
ishing hand, when he was overtaken by his last siekness.
Having made a voyage to Greece, with the intention of visit-
ing Attica and Asia, on arriving at Athens he met Octavian,
