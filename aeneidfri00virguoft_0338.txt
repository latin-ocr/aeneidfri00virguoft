referring to the several ships' companies. 71. Bls septem3 a favorite
mode of expressing numbers in poetry. See Gr. ἓ 118, 5, (b).--—-Corpore;
a limiting ablativo os description. Gr. ξ 211, R. 6; Z. ξ 471. The αῖιίαἰὶυε
of quality or description is more frequent than the finitive. 72. Quarum
qnae etc-3 (cml Deiopea, who (is) tlte fairest of these in form, 11ιώἰί unite to
you in lasting( wedloclc, aad pronounce your own. The nominativo, Deiopea
(which is better authenticated here than Deiopemm given in some editions), is
put by attraction in the case of the relative quae, instead of the accusative,
which would have been the regular construction. See Gr. ἓ 206, (6), (b).
Quarum is translated here as earumque ,· the relative is a closer and neater
connective than and with a demonstrative or personal prononn, which, how·
ever, the Enylislz idiom often requires instead of the Latin relative. See
Arnold’s Lat. Prose Comp., ξ 67, 536; Gng 206, (17). This preference
for the relative in Latin often gives rise to the construction, which we have
herc, of two relatives or intcrrogatives in the same sentence; as, Cic. Brut.
74, 258: eujus penes quos laus adltzccfait. So also the frequently recurring
quae quum ita sint. The yenitz‘ve is not governcd by De'z'opeam understood,
but by the superlative, pulcherrima, as a partitive; Gr. ἓ 212, R. 2. The
form ‘⁴ quae (est)pulche1·rima” is only a poetic substitute sor pulcherrimam.-
tlte most beautiful ⁰f ‘whom (namely), Deiopea, I willjoin, &c. Comp. x. 225.
73. connubio is scanned
here as a trisyllable, connubyo, Gr. ἓ 306; Ζ. ξ 11. Proprius is a strong
word, denoting sure and perpetual possession. Hor. Sat. 2, 6, 53 propria
leaeo milti munera famia. 75. Pulchra prole 3 explained by Thiel as an ab·
lative absolute3 but it seems to inodify faciat in the same way as if he had
said emiza pulchram prolem ; that she may malt-e thee a parent, lzaviny borne
to thee (by bearing to thee) afair offspriny. Thus it is an ablative of means.
76. Haec. Supply ait or dicit, see Gr. ἓ 209, R. 43 Z. ξ 772. Ra-
spondco and dico are not unfrequently omitted. Tuus—lahor3 it is thy
task to weiylc what thou desiresc ‚· that is, I have not the responsibility of de·
ciding whether that be right or wrong which you wish. ⁷⁷. Explorare3
to weiylc; to look into the nature of a thing; referring here to its moral
quality. Aeolus will excuse himself when called to account for trespass-
ing on the dominion of Neptune, by pleading the command of Juno, and his
duty to her. Mihi etc-3 it is incumbent on me to executa yonr orders.
-—capessere; ιο lay hold os with enemy, to (πρηέα,- sce Gr. ξ 187, 5.
Fasg what is iinposed by divine dccrces; here a sacred duty. 78. Tu
mihi. In aseribing to Juno's intercession with Jupiter the power and digni-
ty conscrred upon Aeolus, virgil has probably followed some ancient myth,
in which Jnno, as the iinpcrsonation of the nir, was represented as exercis-
ing some influence over the winds and in thc crcation of a king under whose
control they were placed. Quodcumque etc-3 you secure to me whatsoever
os ‹lominion this (is), yon secure ίο me my sceptre and Jove (i. e. by the fa·
vor of Jove), you gyrant me to recline at the scasts of the yods. Sceptra, as

 

De-i-o-pe-cz forms the last two feet of the verse.
