who happened to be at that time returning from Asia Minor
to Italy. Virgil was easily persuaded by his friend and patron
to return with him immediately to Rome, which, however, he
was not destined again to see. His malady had continually
increased during the voyage, and a few days after landing at
Brundusium he expired. His death occurred in Β. c. 19. His
remains were conveyed from Brundusium to NapleS, and
buried on the hill of Posilippo, in the tomb still preserved and
revcred as the “tomb of Vi1·gil.”

It is said that Virgil, a short time before his death, desired
to burn up his Aeneid, in consequence of the. imperfect state
in which it would necessarily be lest. But being dissuaded
from this purpose by his friends, Tucca and Varius, he direct-
ed them in his will to strike out all the verses which were in-
complete, but to add nothing. It does not appear, however,
that anything was crased by them, unless we admit the ac-
count of some of the grammar-iaus, who alleged that Tucca and
Varius rejected the four verses, Ille eqo, etc., commonly
placed at the beginning, and the passage 567-588 in the sec-
ond book.

The Aeneid, though thus left unfinished, and though liable
to the charge of close imitation of Homer in many passages,
and of borrowing not a little from earlier Roman poets, has
nevertheless always been, aud always will be considered one
of the noblest pocms of antiquity. Α

Virgil found some difficulty in making the calm excellences
of goodness and piety, with which he wished to characterize
his most‘prominent personage, appear heroic and striking 3 and,
like Milton, he has from the necessity of the case suffered the
fury and unbridled passion of some of his characters to make
a more lively and enduring impression than the central per-
sonage of his poem. For it must be admitted that the Turnus
of the Aeneid,'‘and the Satan of Paradise Lost, take a more
powerful hold upon our imaginations, and come nearcr to
Homer’s conception of a herobthan the calm majesty of Mil-
ton's Saviour, or the patient suffering and religious obedience
⁵ of Virgil’s Aeneas.
