BOOK SECOND.

Aeneas recounts to Dido the capture and sack of
Troy.

1-M9. After a brief introduction Aeneas enters upon his narrative, which begins
with the story of the wooden horse. The Greeks, now in the tenth year of the siege,
disheartened by their ill success, resort to stratagem. On the night which precedes
the burning of the city, they pretend to give over the siege, and to take ship for their
homes·, leaving upon the plain, before the walls of Troy, an immense movable fabric
of wood, made to resemble a horse, and of such size that it can be carried into the city
only by enlarging the gate, or breaking down a portion of the wall.

within this fabric are concealed many of the Grecian chiefs, while the army, under
the command of Agamemnon, instead of continuing the voyage, is lurking behind the
island of Tenedos, a few miles from Troy.

The Trojan multitude issues from the gates, and, gathering round the strange
image, hesitate whether to eonvey it into the city, or to desti-oy it.

Atthis moment the cunning Sinon, who has purposely suffered himself to be mado
prisoner, is brought before king Priam, and by his artful story gains the confide-nce of
the king, and leads him and his people to believe that the wood⁴en horse, once placed
within the citadel, will become, like the Palladium, the safeguard of Troy. The de·
vice of Sinon and the Greeks is aided by Minerva, who sends two serpents to slay the
priest Laocoon for attempting to destroy the image consecrated to her. This prodigy
confirms the Trojans in the purpose already formed, and by means of ropes and rollers
they convey the wooden horse through the city to the citadel.
