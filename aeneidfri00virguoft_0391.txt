period, which, being rolled up to the walls of the besieged city, enabled the
assailants from the several stories and froin the summit of the tower to hurl

 

 

their missiles, and to pass over upon planks to the battlements of the be-
sieged. Thus the Greeks might intend to use the wooden horse. For the
use of the future participle here, see Gr. ξ 274, R. 6, (a); Z. ξ 639. Ven-
tura desuper rather refers to the descent of those in the machine upon the

expression to similar poetic archaisms in Lucretius aud Plautus; as, anxius
anyer, Luc. i. 8263 sonitus sonans, id. iii. 8163 pulchra pulchritudo, Plaut.
