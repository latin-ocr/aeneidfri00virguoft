His brother Pandarus was samed for archery, and under the direction of
Minerva (jussus) had broken off the truce with the Greeks, by diseharging
an arrow at Menelaus. Hom. Il. ii., iv. 88 sq. 4518. Acestem for the

(of her wings); in 215, the noise of a bird's wings is described in similar
ternis. The language can hardly refer to applause given by the spectators,
as this was not the degree of success which would call for it, and noue is
mentioned as given sor more lueky marksmen afterwards. 50⁷. Adducto

the noise of the bow, would show the strength and skill of old Acestes.

and destined to prove of ,areat portent. The yreat result subsequently επ·
plained it, and tlte dread sootlzsayers interpreted tlze omens too late. Had
Virgil revised the poem he might perhaps have elaborated this passage,‚and
saved his eommentators much perplexity. Did he intend at this particular
point to foreshadow, by the burning of an arrow in the air, that Aeneas
should be engaged in war in Italy? Did he wish to foreshadow the war of
the Romans against the Carthaginians and Sicilians‘? It is diffieult to see
what motive virgil could have had for introducing at this point an omen
referring to either of these events. In regard to the latter, how could
soothsayers in the time of the Punic wars be supposed to know any thing
about an arrow which chaneed to be shot by Acestes nine hundred years
before? On the whole it seems most probable that the omen is connected
in Virgil's mind with the burning of the ships, described below, 659 sq.—

the burning of the ships. But if ingens may describe the clapping of a
