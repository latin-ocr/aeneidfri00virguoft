the meaning of reyio quoted in the lexicons. 738—740. This passage
has created much difficulty on account of the irregular construction and
arrangement of the words. Mihi is naturally understood after conjux
erepta, and misero agrees with milei. Below, in verse ’ἲ 6 sq„ the ghost
of Creiisa reveals to Aeneas that she is in the service of the goddess
Cybele, but leaves him uncertain how she was taken away3 and this is still

from me‚unlzappy one! by fate remain behind? did she wander from tlte
path? did 8]ae sit down weary? (It is) uncertain. The questions are di·

Ore-asa, even venturing into the midst of the Greeks, who now hold complete posses-
sion. The shade of Creiisa appears to him, consoles his grief, assures him of her hap-
piness, and predicte his final settlement in Italy. He returns to his friends, who have
