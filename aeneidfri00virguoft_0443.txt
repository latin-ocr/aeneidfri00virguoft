riaye ties of Pyrrhus ⁴? The wife of the principal defende: of Troy, are yoi
now united with Troy's bitterest enemy? Not said in reproach, but in grief
that her hard fate is such. Ladewig adopts the* conjectural reading of
⁸ Peerlkamp in this passage. Thus: Aut quae cliffim salis fortuna ret-ixit
Hectoris Andromachen? Pyrrhin' connubia servas? For the genitive,
Hectoris, see Gr. ξ 211, R. 73 Z. ξ 761. Ε in the interrogative ne is some-
times elided as here in Pyrrhin'. 320. Deiecit. She feels humiliated,
though innoeent of any voluntary nstscondmzt, and therefore she answers
with downcast looks. She is the vietim of necessity and fate, but she ean-
not escape some sense of shame in the thought of her connection with Ne-
optolemus. 321. Virgo. The allusion is to Polyxena, the daughter of
Priam. She was slain as a sacrifice at the ‘tomb of Achilles, who had been
enamored of her, and had sought her hand in marriage. 323. Jussag

328. LacedaemoniOS3 Hermione was the daughter of Menelaus of Lacedae-
mon, and of Helen, the daughter of Leda. Her grandparents, Tyndareus
and Leda, had promised her in marriage to Orestes, but her father gave her
to Pyrrhus. Orestes, already frantie with the consciousness of having mur-
dered his mother, (scelerum Furiis ayitatus‚) and still more maddencd at the
· loss of his betrothed, (ereptae coijis) came upon Pyrrhus at Delphi, where
he was worshipping at the altar ereeted to Achilles, (patrias crass) and
slew him. 329. Famulamque. The particle que here connects famulo
and famulam, in the sense of ctiam, or et ipsam ; 9az'e mc to Helenus a slave,

a prophet had saved Pyrrhus on his homeward voyage, and thus won his
gratitude. 335. Trojano Chaone. Chaon was a friend or brother of
Helenus, for whom he is said to have sacrificed his life. The name of Cha-
onia, however, appears to date farther back than the time of Aeneas.
