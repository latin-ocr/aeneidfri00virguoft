sense of animis accipere. lilerimm malis advertite numen; literally, turn
your deserved power to my wocs ,· {sive need to my yricfs, for I deser-ve your
pity. Peerlkamp and others refer malis to the Trojans, as the evil orsalse
ones, who deservo punishment3 which, however, does not seem to be the
natural inter-[metation os the passage—612. Si, with the indicative here,
is an expression of her conviction that so it must bc3 almost equivalent to
quoniam. Perhaps Vix-gil has in mind the idea, not uncommon with the
aneients, that, 011 the verge of death the future becomes more clear, and
thus Dido sees with certainty that which awaits Aeneas. Ladewig quotes·
Cic. de div. i. 30, animus appropinquante morte :multo est divinior, and refers
to Hector’s prophecy of the death of Achilles, Hom. 11. xxi. 338 sq. The
prophetie curse of Dido was fulfilled in the dangers and losses which Aeneas
met with in the war with Turnus, who, with his brave Rutulians, came near
destroying the Trojans. Aeneas was on this occasion obliged to leave As-
canius and his followers in the camp near the Tiber, and to scel< help from
Evander. He perished in the fourth year after finishing the war and mal<-
ing a treaty with the Latius, and was finallrde13rived of burial (the heaviest
curse of all) because his body could not be found. 513. capnt3 sor the

cive or subjunctive may follow this phrase. 614. llic terminus haeret3 the
omission of et before this clause is allowable, and even a beauty, if wc con-
sider the manner in which the line would naturally be prononnced. Lade-
wig refers terminus to the ending( of the wanderings of Aeneas-his fated
arrival in Italy3 but it is usually understood as meaning the limit of things—
the fixcd order of things. Thus the sentiment would be: ²f this order of
things is fioeed (by the fates), so that my prayers, so that the gods cannot

affect it; yet let the gods sulfil my wishes in regard to the Subsequent sor-
“ tunes of Aeneas. 618. Funera 3 on his return from Evander, he witnessed
the havoc which had been made in his army. Sub leges pacis iniquam
under the terms of an uvzequal peace ,· the chief disadvantage of the Trojans
in the peace made with the Latius, was the loss of their separate nationality,
and their language. 619. Luce, for vim—(320. Ante dicm3 before the
time usually allotted to the life of man3 prematurely. It is said by some
that hc was drowned in the river Numicius, and that his body was never
found. But Livy, 1. 1, e. 2, says he was buried ou the bank of the Numicius.
