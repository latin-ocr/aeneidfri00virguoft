350 Nomas oN THE AENEm.

-—;Viris. See Gr. ξ 226. Linqnant and, 518, veniant, are substituted for
the peifect because the actions are conceived as scarcely yet finished.-—
Quid is the adverbial accusative: as to what, why? Cuncti, translate in
the predam, after veniant ,· thy they come all (toyctlter). For he had sup·
posed them to be separated from each other by the tempest. Cuncti is, all
taken {welhe-r, as opposed to dispersi. See Diiderlein, also Arnold's L. P. C.
443. The reading cunctis agreeing with navibus occurs in very few of 3¹¹⁰
manuscripts, though it would seem the more natural. Navibusg from the
ships. See note on 2. lbant3 for veniebant,· for the pluperfect, they
had come‚· just so veniant for the perfect, they have come. 519. orantes
veniam to sue sorfavor; that is, here, sor protection. See 526, and comp.
iii. 114; the present participle is used to denote a purpose, instead of ad
orandam, or ut (qui) orarent. Gr. ξ 274, R. 2, (a). The construction oc-
curs also in prose, as, Zeyatz' missi auxilium orantes. Liv. 21, 6. 520·
Introgressi· Which is the better form of the auxiliary to be supplied here—-
erant? or sunt ‚2———Col'am- Supply reqi71a; before the queen.-——Copla
fandig an opportunity ofspealcz'wy. Gr. ξ 183, 6. 521. Maximus. Sup-
ply natu. The eldest‚· literally, yreatest in respect to aye. See on 654.
Some prefer to take maximus in a more general sense: tlte first amongy them
in aye, rank, and difflzity. How many syllables does the scanning of the
verse require in Ilioneus? Placidog calm, though like Neptune, 126,
yraviter commotus. 522. Condere. For the infinitive depending on dare,
see note on 66, above. 523. Gentes superb853 proud natione. It refers
to the neighboring barbarians, not to the Oarthaqz‘nians. And if the term
frenare seems out of keeping with the little colony of Carthage, we must
remember the stately scene before Ilioneus,—-the queen upon her throne in
a magnificent temple, surrounded by guards, and by a multitude of her peo-
ple. She is administeringjustice to them3 hence the propriety of invoking
her power to rcpel the insolence of her suleects, who are attempting to
drive the unhappy Trojans from the shore. See 540, 541. 524. Observe
the emphatic position os Troe& Marii! is either governed by a preposi-
tion, circum or per, understood, or by vecti, taken in an active sense: Ιιαυ·
iny naviyated, or traverscd all scas. The latter construction is preferred
by Thiel. Velzor osten means naviqo, aud the latter sometimes governs the
accusative, as above in 07, navique aequor. 526. Generl. Gr. ’δ’ 223, R. 2.
