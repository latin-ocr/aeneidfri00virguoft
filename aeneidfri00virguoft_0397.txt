tlte hope os the Greeks begam to wane, and ylidc'ny down, to be carried back·
again. This metaphor seems to be drawn from a ship which the rowers
have suddenly ceased to propel against the current, so that it again falls
down the stream. Such is YVagner's explanation, which is snstained by G.

124. That an image should show such miraculous signs of anger, is a suf-
ficient reason to the minds of the Trojans, as Sinon is well aware, for the

fore no difficulty now in belicving that the Greeks have actually gone, and
that what Sinon adds about the destination of the wooden horse is reason-
able and true. 178. Omina ni repetant Argi53 unless they seelc τΙιε omens

Here Sinon comes to the most delicate part of his story, he must give a
plausible reason both for the building of the horse, and sor its vast size, and
