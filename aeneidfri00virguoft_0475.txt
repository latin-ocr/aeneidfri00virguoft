will repay yenerouslgs. cumulatam, agreeing with quam, means lzeaped
up, Zaryely increased. Morte is an ablative of time, as below, 502. The
above seems to be the most natural interpretation of this troublesome and
much disputed passage. 438. Fertque refertque3 both bears, and bears
ayain, these various appea‘ls to Aeneas. Repcated and earnest action is

message of Aeneas. Fatis exterrita 3 rendered frantie bys Izer terrible fatae,
or destiny. But Ladewig refers fatis to the faces or-oracles, which controlled

it were caught on the premises of any private family, it was nailed to the
door, that its own death might serve as a preventive sacrificeto avert the
death which its cry was supposed to presage in the family. CulminibuS3
