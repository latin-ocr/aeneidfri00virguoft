Cumae, a city situated on the coast of Campania, was founded in very
ancient times by a colony of Greeks from Chalcis, (now Negropont‚) in the
island of Euboea3 hence the terms Euboean and chalcidam are applied to
the city of Cumae and to objects connected with it. Strabo calls Cumae the
most ancient of all the Italian and Sicilian cities. After passing through
many vicissitudes of fortune, it was at last utterly destroyed in the thirteenth
century by the people of Naples and Aversa. Its site, marked by the ruins
of temples and villas, is often visited by modern travellers. The following
view of Cumae and its environs presents in the distance near the sea the
abrupt height of the Acropolis, on which stood the temple of Apollo and
grove of Diana. In its sides were excavated many subterranean passages,
some of which communieated with the holy place of the oracle, or grotto of
the Sibyl. These caverns are still in existence, and have been cleared out
and explored to some extent, though mostly filled with ruins and rubbish.
