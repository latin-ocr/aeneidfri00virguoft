ponet3 he shall establis-h lamt- (mores), and a city (moenia) for his people (vi-
ris). Ponere is used alike with mores (or loyes), and with moenia. Mores,
is here constitution, or civil orffanization, and laws. Comp. vi. 852, viii. 316.
Some understand by viris the conquered people, the Rutuli and Etrusci, or
feroces populos, mentioned 111 263. But we have below, 507, (labat legyes viris,
said of Dido and her own pcople, where viris stands precisely in the same
relation to the queen as the same word here to Aeneas. 265, 266. He
shall be engaged in this work of establishing his power (shall reign) three
years, after having subdued Turnus and the Rutulians. Then (wc are to
understand) he shall be taken into heaven. According to some traditions
Aeneas was drowned in the N umicius; according to others he was slain in
battle, and buried on the banks of that river. This period of three years is
expressed here by tertia aestas and terna hzbei na meaning three Summers
and three winters. Regnantem 15 not “beyinnz'ny his reign, '’ but “continu-
iny his reign.'’ For the distributive numeral in terna hiberna (tempora),
see Gr. ἓ 120, 4; Ζ. ἓ 119. Wunderlich is followed by Thiel and others in
making Rutulis subactis the dative aster transierint, by a Greek construction.
But whether we take it as a dative, or as an ablativo absolute, which seems
preferable, the sense is, “after the subjection of the Rutulians.” Literally‚
until the third summer shall have seen him reiyniny, and three winters shall
have passed away, the Rutulians havingy been subdued. 267. At often de-
notes the transition to a new idea or new topic, not inconsistent with the
foregoing, but merely different from it. Bac and now are so used in Eng-
lish. Ascanius, the son of Aeneas and Creiisa, is accompanying his father
in his wanderings. Iulo· For the dative case here see Gr. ξ 204, R. S;
Z. ξ 421, note. The name Iulus appears to have been invented by the Ju-
lian family, or by their eulogists, as the form from which to derive Julius,
and as bearing some resemblance ro the name of the Trojan king Ilus,
founder of Ilium. No authentic tradition ascribed such a name to Ascanius,
or, as he was also named, Euryleon. Julius Caesar, in his eulogy upon his
deceased aunt, J ulia the wife of Marius, boasted of this high descent: Pa-
ternum yenus cum diis immortalibus conjunctum est—nam a Venere Julii eu-
jus gentis familia est nostra. Suet. J ul. caes. 1, 7. 268. 11115. Ascanius
is faneied to have been so called after his ancestor, the king mentioned in
the last note. —Dum—regno‚ uhile the Ilian state flour ishad in its sover-
