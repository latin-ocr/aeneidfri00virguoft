coast of the Caspian Sca. Admorunt ubera3 ⁸slave thee such. 368. Nam
quid dissimulo. Dido now casts off all restraint. She had entertained some
hope ofmoving him, in the belief that he was sincere, and that his love had
but for a moment yielded to ambition3 but she now feels that she has been

 

 

deceived, and she scorns the idea of appearing any longer as a suppliant,
where her passion is really unrequited. Therefore‚ why should she conceal
her indignation ? Why should she seek to win him back? Why reserve
herself, or restrain her feelings, for some greater outrage—what greater,
indeed, can she expect? 369. Fletu is in the dative aster z'nyemuit. Ob-

this clause is understood in two ways: 1. What shall Isags before what? to
what feeling shall Ι first give utterance? 2. To what outa-ages shall I prefer

interrogative, in the dative after anteferam. A relative and interrogative,

384. Atris ignibu53 with smoky fires‚· either suggested by the idea of the
furies, who pursued the guilty with whips and torches, or by the anticipa-

to your conscience, like a fury3 and when I am dead, my ghost shall haunt
