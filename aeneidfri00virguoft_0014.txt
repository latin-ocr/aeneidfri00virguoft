The illustrative euts which accompany the notes have
been taken mostly from Vollmer's Dictionary of Mythol-
ogy, and from Hope’s Costumes of „the Ancients. They
have been selected for the purpose of illustrating ancient
usageS, arts, costumes, utensils‚ and implements of war,
and also as a means of imparting to the reader some ade-
quate idea of the classic gods and heroes as they existed
in the minds of Virgil and the poets of his day. Virgil
and his contemporaries, when speaking of the deities of
mythology, undoubtedly had in view just such forms as
have come down to us in the numberless statues, bas-
reliefs‚ wall-paintings‚ vase-paintings‚ and intaglios‚ which
fill up the museums of Europe. Some of the most re-
markable of these are represented in this work( A list
of the wood-euts, followed by an alphabetical index' of
the things illustrated, will be found below. ⁴
