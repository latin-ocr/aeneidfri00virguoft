Penatesg put by metonymy (Gr. g 324, 2) for heartlzs οι· homes—528.
nuptas—vertere. In English, to seize and drive away. See note above, on
69. Vertere is for avertere (comp. viii. 208), and refers especially to the
captives, and the cattle, which would form the most valuable part of the
booty. Praedas is stronger than praedam. 529. Eag such. Animo,

Hesperiam3 which tlte Greeks call Hesperia by name. Gr. ξ 23ος Ζ, ξ 394.
The other accusative here is quam understood. In the verse of Ennius
Ann. 1, 36, from which this is taken by virgil, the quam is expressed:
“ Est locus, Hesperiam quam mortales perhibebant.⁷’ Hesperia, from ἕσπερος,
vesper, is properly the western land. The term was frequently applied by
the Greeks and Romans to Italy and sometimes to Spain. 531. Potens3

532. Oenotri. These people were said to be kindred with the Pelasyi
of Greeee, and also with the Siculi, and to have occupied Bruttium and Lu-
cania, in the south of the Italian peninsula. Italia was originally another “
designation for the same part of the peninsula, but was gradually extended
in its application, until in the time of Augustus it came to signify‚ as in
modern geography, the whole country south of the Alps. Famag predi-
cate nominative after est understood; of which dixisse is the subject. Gr.

this leader was Italus, a king of the Oenotri, or, according to Thucydides,
of the Siculi. 534. Hic} this was our course. Hie must not be mistaken
for an adverb here. Huc is found in some editions, but not on good author—
ity. This verse, like inany others in the Aeneid‚ was left unfinished, though
the sense is complete, as indeed in nearly all other instances, where such
verses occur. See iii. 340, and vi. 94.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

535. Assurgeus fluctu3 risiny
from the wave. See on Italiam, 2. In the language of the Romans, a star
is said to set heliacally (heliaee), when it disappears in the sun’s rays just
aster sunset‚ and to rise heliae-ally, when it appears in the east a little before
sunrise. When it rises and sets exactly- with the sun, which happens in tha
interval of six weeks between its heliacal setting and heliacal rising, it is said
to ‘rise and set cosmically (cosmice). About five months after its heliacal
rising the star rises and sets opposite the sun. This is called its aeronicat'
rising and setting. Resides these descriptive terms, also the expressions
matutino, mane, vesperi, vespertinus, and cum sole, were sometimes employed
'm connection with the words that denote ris-inq and settz'ny. More fre·
quently, however, as here, the reader is left to infer which kind of rising or
