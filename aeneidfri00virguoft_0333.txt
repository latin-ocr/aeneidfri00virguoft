'rna poem is entitled the Aeneid because it describes the fortunes of Aeneas. In
writing it, Virgil, who possessed an eminently religious mind and an earnest patriot-
lsm, aimed not only to secure to himself a higher poetic fame, but also to exalt tho

glory of Rome, and to bring his countrymen back to that traditional reverence for
their religion which had in former ages given the nation its wonderful strength of
character.

THE INSORIPTION.

Ille—Martis. The authenticity of these four lines is doubtful. If they
were written by virgil, which is by no means improbable, they were not
designed as 'the beginning of the epic‚ but only as a kind of inscription or
epigr-aph. There is also some uncertainty about the construction of the
sentence. Peerlkamp supposes an ellipsis at the end, something like this:
quam vereor ut vires tanto operi sufficiant. Others supply sum with eqo, and
connect horrentia stIartis with arma, thus : Ille eqo sum, qui modulatus sum
