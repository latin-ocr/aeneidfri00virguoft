604—699. The conflagration of vthe ships While the gaines are in progress, <luno
sends Iris down to excite discontent among the Trojau women, who are assembled
near the shore, and not witnessing the games, but gazing mournfully on the sea, while
they bemoan the death of Anchises. While they are grieving that so much of the sea
is still to be crossed, and that they cannot put. an end to their hardships by settling in
Sicily, Iris presents herself in the form of Beroe, a Trojan matron, and gives utterance
to the feelings which fill them all. They are roused to fury, and, seizing firc-brands
from the altars of Neptune, on which sacrifices are burning near the water, they hurl
them into the ships. Presently the alarm is conveyed by Eumelus to the Trojan as-
sembly at. the tomb of Anchises. Ascanius, having scarcely completed the cavalry
exercise, hastens on his horse, followed by Aeneas and the rest, to extinguish the fire.
But it has already penetrated into the holds of the ships, and an human efforts are
unavailing. Aeneas then calls upon Jupiter, who answers his prayer by sending down
a flood of rain, and preserving all the ships, save four.

ued favor throughout the day, which she now violates, by suddenly bringing
evil. To chanye herself, or her aspect, and make new saith, is to be treacle*-
