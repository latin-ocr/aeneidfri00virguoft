1-41. Aeneas sees sar off at sea the light of Dido’s funeral pile, and with sad scel-
ings div1nes the cause. His fleet is soon overtaken by a storm, and forced to steer sor
the coast os Sicily, where he is again kindly received by Acestes.

l. Interea; in the mean ἤπια,- i. e. while the scenes mentioned at the
end of the Fourth Book were transpiring at Carthage. 1,2. Medium
tenebat iter3 was fully on his way. Any part of the way on the open sea,

wind blackens the waves, and that an adverse wind would account for
Aeneas remaining so long in sight of Carthage. Thiel and Ladewig are
among those who prefer the literul rendering os the word here. Thiel joins
the ablat. aquilone with secabat, others with atros. 3. Elissae3 Dido.
Sec iv. 335. 4. Quae attenderim does the poet represent this ns his own
conception, or as an idea passing in the niind os Aeneas and the Trojans?
